    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone!​</p>
    <p>Ky here.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to open this website to support my web novel, Phantasm Demontia – Book I: Modulation. 
      It follows a rather boring lazy man from our world who is granted godlike powers, only to watch his world turn to dust. 
      Now, on a mission to figure out why—and how—he can either reverse the destruction or deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an excerpt from Chapter 7:​
      "The beam pierced the Earth and shattered it into a cloud of colorful dust. 
      Not an explosion, not an implosion. 
      An impossible phenomenon. 
      Then the magnificent beast took in a breath, the colorful dust particles sucked into its gaping maw. 
      The once vibrant world was reduced to a faint glimmer of what it had been.?"​

      If you're a fan of blending the elements of fantasy and sci fi, Phantasm Demontia – Book I: Modulation might be your next read.
