    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
    <p>Ky here.</p>
    <p>I'm an author, game developer, software creator, and music composer based in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
  
    <p>Writing has been a part of my life since childhood — I’ve always been drawn to storytelling in some form. 
        While I’ve studied writing and communication academically through my bachelor’s and master’s degrees, my deepest learning has come from simply creating worlds, characters, and the emotional chaos that binds them together.</p>
  
    <p><strong>Phantasm Demontia</strong> originally began as the story for a video game. 
        I created it as a 2D metroidvania, but also attempted to make it a tactical RPG like <em>Fire Emblem</em> — and someday, I'll try to make an MMORPG. 
        It's why I taught myself programming and music composition. 
        But as I developed the story further, I realized that what I truly wanted was to tell it through writing. 
        That shift led to the beginning of the web novel you see now.
    </p>
  
    <p>The story blends genres — comedy, horror, sci-fi, fantasy, romance — and can get quite dark and violent.
        Some characters suffer unimaginable loss. 
        Others face cruel relationships or psychological torment. 
        I wanted each arc to hit hard — to make you feel *something*, whether it’s laughter, grief, anger, or hope.</p>
  
    <p>Outside of writing, I work professionally in IT.
        I continue to build games, write code, and compose music in my free time. 
        But more and more, writing is where I feel at home. 
        It’s the one creative outlet that ties all the others together.
        Ultimately, the goal now is to publish the trilogy traditionally but publishing as a webnovel has been quite fulfilling in itself.</p>
  
    <p>Thanks for visiting my site and taking a look at my work. 
        I hope <em>Phantasm Demontia</em> stays with you long after you’ve finished reading — just like it’s stayed with me since the beginning.</p>
