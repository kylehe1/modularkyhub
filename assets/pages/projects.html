    Here is what started it all, the <strong>Phantasm Demontia</strong> video game — blending my love of storytelling, coding, and music into one immersive experience.

  <h3>Phantasm Demontia – The Game</h3>

  <p>
    Enter a haunting, pixelated world in this 2D metroidvania-style game. Choose between two powerful Generals — <strong>Feruzula</strong> or <strong>Erngarr</strong> — and battle through sectors of the Neo Empire, overrun by the zombie force known as <em>Condemnia</em>.<br>
    The story follows events from the <strong>Kaiden's Nightmare Arc</strong> in the first book, reimagined through atmospheric exploration, fast-paced combat, and narrative-rich environments. Each level is handcrafted with Asperite.
