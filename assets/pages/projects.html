  <p>Besides creating the <strong>Phantasm Demontia</strong> novel, I also dabbled in game development and composing music for the game.</p>

  <h3>Phantasm Demontia – The Game</h3>

  <p>
    The game starts with you picking your favorite General. Right now there are only two to choose from: <strong>Feruzula</strong> and <strong>Erngarr</strong>.<br>
    You go through sector by sector of the Neo Empire, fighting the <em>Condemnia</em> infection as told in <strong>Kaiden's Nightmare Arc</strong> of the first book — all in 2D pixel side-scrolling action!
