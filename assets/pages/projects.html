    Here is what started it all, <strong>Phantasm Demontia!</strong>
  </p>

  <h3>Phantasm Demontia – Incomplete</h3>
  <img src="assets/images/titlescreen.png" alt="Phantasm Demontia Title Screen" class="project-image" />

  <p>
    A 2D metroidvania-style game. 
    Choose between two of the 7 Generals — <strong>Feruzula</strong> or <strong>Erngarr</strong> — and battle through multiple sectors of the Neo Empire, overrun by the undead force known as <em>Condemnia</em>.<br>
    The story follows events from <strong>Kaiden's Nightmare </strong> arc in the first book, reimagined through atmospheric exploration, fast-paced combat, and narrative-rich environments. 
    <br>Each level was handcrafted with Asperite.
    <br>One day it will be complete and on Steam. One day. But I am currently focused on finishing my books first.
    <br>Perhaps if I had more collaborations, it would finally be complete. But for now. BOOK!
